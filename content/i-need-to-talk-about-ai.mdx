summary: "The impact of AI on how we consume and create content, and why it's frustrating."

I need to speak up. The problem might not be AI itself, but the effects it brings are creating issues and I'm starting to get tired of it.

I'm someone who loves sharing the code I develop, the articles I read, and the knowledge I learn. One proof of this is that I started blogging 7 years ago. After that, I became active on Twitter.

There, I had the opportunity to meet wonderful people. Even though my content didn't get much attention, I loved the feeling of people responding. It wasn't just about a like. It was about them providing meaningful output.

For example, I developed my personal website as open source. Over the years, it became simpler, more usable, and had higher quality code. During this process, it received 72 stars and nearly 10 forks.

One random day, I visited a site and saw my website's infrastructure. The basic design was the same, but they had made additions. I realized how right that decision was and felt happy. That's a result.

However, as time passed, everything changed. Simple production brought simple consumption. And today, I'm going to rebel against this.

It doesn't matter if your work is good or bad, because the people who like it or praise it won't even bother to look at it.

We consume so easily. Software has become like a SaaS tool. You pay money to develop something, and it gets developed. Is that so bad? You can choose not to pay and write it yourself, but is it worth it?

At the end of the day, when people look at your project, they only think: "I can do this too using X tool." Effort, thought, and hard work turn into garbage.

Maybe this doesn't apply to the code you write at work. Your output goals are different there. But if you're publishing this as an open source project and sharing it with excitement, it's disappointing.

Previously, developers would get frustrated with clients who asked for many small changes and said things like "it's just desk work, you're comfortable," trying to trivialize people's efforts. Today, we're doing this to ourselves.

I'm developing a project with enthusiasm. A page for documentation, supported by a GitHub README and diagrams. On top of that, I'm writing a blog about usage examples and why and how it works. What's the result?

<Callout>What exactly does this do?</Callout>

Yes, that's it. Disappointment. We all agree that people can be curious and read things whenever they want. But are people acting mindlessly despite all this supportive content?

Maybe you didn't explain well what you did? Yes, that could be, but if that's the case, wouldn't they ask "I didn't understand exactly what this is useful for"? Especially when there are supportive explanations available for them.

It's that simple. Communicating with people is like talking to a wall, and it's terrible. First, you develop, then you share. After that, you respond to these ridiculous questions and try to convince them. What's the result? "Nice!" That's it. They'll still continue without caring.

I'm in awe of good code, properly working architecture, and engineering. But these responses from people with great titles but no real understanding make me feel disappointed every day.

I don't know where this is going, but I can say it's a terrible path.
