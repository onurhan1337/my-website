**Clean Code** by Robert Martin

Just finished re-reading the chapter on functions. The "Do One Thing" principle seems obvious but it's incredibly hard to follow in practice. Every time I think I've mastered it, I find myself writing functions that do two or three things.

The key insight: if you can't describe what your function does without using "and", it's probably doing too much.
