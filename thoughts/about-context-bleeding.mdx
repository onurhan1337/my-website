```typescript
// Context isolation fix in RSC tracing
// enterWith() was causing user data to leak between parallel renders
// run() isolates each execution and prevents silent corruption

asyncLocalStorage.run(newContext, () => {
  renderReactServerComponent();
});
```

A single line caused traces from User A to appear in User Bâ€™s metrics.
Replacing enterWith() with run() fixed it. Slower by 20%, but correctness wins.
In async-heavy environments, context isolation is survival, not optional.
